## Features

- **Lead pipeline** — track leads through *Not Contacted → Contacted → Completed / Lost* with per-status counts and conversion rate
- **Multi-branch support** — branches with codes, addresses, coordinates and a radius, used to auto-assign leads by location
- **Lead segmentation** — separate views for *Valid (Tamil Nadu)*, *Invalid phone*, and *Outside* territory
- **Auto branch assignment** — geocode a lead's city and assign the nearest active branch within its radius
- **Multi-user access** — role-based accounts (ADMIN / USER / SUPERADMIN) scoped to a branch, a platform, or everything
- **Consultant assignment** — assign leads to sales consultants and track per-consultant performance
- **Activity audit log** — every status change, remark, and reassignment is recorded with the acting user and timestamp
- **Follow-up calendar** — two follow-up dates per lead, surfaced in a monthly calendar view
- **Google Sheets sync** — pull leads from a linked spreadsheet, with automatic column mapping
- **External lead upload** — CSV/XLSX import with a column-mapping preview before commit
- **Duplicate detection** — phone-number fingerprinting flags repeat enquiries
- **Excel export** — export the current filtered view to `.xlsx`
- **Push notifications** — new-lead and follow-up-due alerts via web push
- **Admin impersonation** — an admin can act as any consultant for support and debugging

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma 7 (with `@prisma/adapter-pg`)
- **Auth:** JWT sessions in an `HttpOnly` cookie (`jose`), scrypt password hashing
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/sga_tata?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="<a-long-random-string>"

ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="<admin-password>"

SUPERADMIN_USERNAME="sudo"
SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD="<superadmin-password>"
```

### 3. Create the schema

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Run

```bash
npm run dev     # development
npm run build && npm start   # production
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000/login> and sign in with the admin credentials above. The default admin user is created automatically on first login.

## Data Model

- **Lead** — name, phone, city, ad name, branch, status, two follow-up dates, remark, platform, assigned consultant, phone fingerprint, invalid-phone and manual-branch flags
- **Branch** — name, code, address, city, coordinates, assignment radius, active flag
- **Consultant** — name and branch
- **User** — username, hashed password, role, optional branch/platform scope
- **LeadActivity** — immutable audit entries (actor, action, old → new value)
- **HiddenLead** — leads suppressed from the default view
- **LocationCache** — geocoding results to avoid repeat lookups
- **Settings** — per-deployment configuration
