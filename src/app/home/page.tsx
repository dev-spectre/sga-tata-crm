          <p>
            SGA Tata CRM is a private, self-hosted web application used by dealership staff to
            import, track, assign and report on automotive sales leads. It replaces manual
            spreadsheet tracking with a secure, role-based dashboard.

          <h3>What the application does</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Lead pipeline</strong> — track leads through <em>Not Contacted → Contacted →
              Completed / Lost</em> with per-status counts and conversion rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multi-branch, multi-consultant</strong> — leads are assigned to consultants
              within branches; filters and reports slice by branch, consultant, platform and date.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Google Sheets synchronisation</strong> — authorised administrators connect a
              Google account (OAuth) to read and write lead data in the organisation's
              spreadsheets. Scopes used:
              <code>spreadsheets</code>, <code>drive.readonly</code>,
              <code>userinfo.email</code>, <code>userinfo.profile</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Activity log & audit trail</strong> — every status change, remark and
              assignment is recorded with timestamp and user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Follow-up calendar</strong> — monthly view of scheduled follow-ups across
              all consultants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platform tagging</strong> — leads tagged by source (Walk-in, Website,
              Facebook, etc.) with configurable colour badges.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Google OAuth integration</h3>
          <p>
            The only Google integration is <strong>spreadsheet synchronisation</strong>. An
            administrator may link a Google account via OAuth to enable automatic import/export of
            lead data between the CRM and the dealership's Google Sheets. The application requests
            the minimum scopes required for this feature and adheres to the{" "}
