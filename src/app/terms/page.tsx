        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern access to and use of the SGA Tata
          CRM application (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), operated by SGA Tata
          (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). By signing in to the Service
          you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is an internal lead-management system for automotive dealership staff. It
          allows authorised personnel to import, track, assign and report on sales leads, and to
          synchronise lead data with Google Sheets spreadsheets that the organisation controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service is intended for use only by employees and authorised contractors of SGA
          Tata. Access is provisioned by an administrator and is not offered as a public or
          consumer service.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Accounts and Access</h2>
        <p>
          Access requires credentials issued by an administrator. You are responsible for keeping
          your credentials confidential and for all activity that occurs under your account. You
          must notify us promptly if you believe your account has been compromised.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend or revoke access at any time, including where we reasonably believe these
          Terms have been breached.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Google Account Integration</h2>
        <p>
          An administrator may choose to connect a Google account to the Service to enable
          spreadsheet synchronisation. When this is done, the Service requests the following
          Google API scopes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Sheets</strong> (<code>spreadsheets</code>) &mdash; to read, write,
            append and update lead data in spreadsheets owned by the organisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Drive (read-only)</strong> (<code>drive.readonly</code>) &mdash; to
            list and read the spreadsheet files the organisation chooses to sync, and to identify
            the connected account&rsquo;s email address.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Basic profile and email</strong> (<code>userinfo.email</code>,{" "}
            <code>userinfo.profile</code>) &mdash; to display which Google account is connected.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Service does not request access to Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Contacts, or any
          other Google service. The Service never requests write access to Google Drive beyond the
          spreadsheet content itself, and does not delete or alter files it did not create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the{" "}
          <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"

          , including the Limited Use requirements. Google account data is used solely to provide
          the spreadsheet synchronisation described in these Terms.

        <p>
          You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access at our
          discretion. Provisions that by their nature should survive termination &mdash; including
          data ownership, liability limits and governing law &mdash; will survive.
